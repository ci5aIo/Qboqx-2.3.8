This version of the market plugin includes changes to allow for hierarchical
assets.

The hierarchy is as follows:

marketcategory
family
parent
individual
element

When you create a basic asset, you specify the title, description,
marketcategory, tags, image, and access.

The possible market categories are defined in the market plugin settings.

Depending upon the marketcategory selected and the available form definitions, 
the user can optionally add additional information when adding or editing 
an asset.

In order to define a level in the hierarchy, you need to define an edit form
and a display view. These will then be automatically picked up by the system.

The edit forms should be located in the views/default/forms/market/edit 
directory.

The display views should be located in the views/default/market/display
directory.

There is one included example directory for a "shoes" marketcategory. This
supports two "shoes" family levels: running and dress.

The main shoes form is in:

 views/default/forms/market/edit/shoes.php
 
 and the family sublevel forms are defined in
 
 views/default/forms/market/edit/shoes/running.php
 and
 views/default/forms/market/edit/shoes/dress.php
 
 If you wanted to continue the hierarchy to the parent level 
 (say for men and women) these forms would be in, for example
 
 views/default/forms/market/edit/shoes/dress/men.php
 and
 views/default/forms/market/edit/shoes/dress/women.php
 
 and the dress.php form would need to define a "parent" field
 with possible values men or women.
 
 The display views are organized in a similar hierarchical way.


 Textual data can be saved automatically by the system, this includes arrays of values.
 Relationships and file uploads need to be handled on a per-form basis, in this case a custom action
 needs to be defined.  To do this simply create the file in the pattern of /actions/custom/[category]/[level].php
 So for example if custom processing needs to happen at the family level of a category called 'car', then you would
 create a php file to handle that at the location /actions/custom/car/family.php
 The car category contains examples of all types of inputs, single string, multiple string arrays, relationships,
 and file uploads.  The file upload system has been modified to be as easy to understand as possible, with copy/paste
 code and a single metadata point storing the file location.

 The edit url of items may be different for different categories (they will be for any following this logic) and they
 can be set in switch statement of the function market_entity_menu in start.php
 See there for an example (the car category)
